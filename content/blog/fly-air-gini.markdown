The other day at OrgTheory, Beth Berman [had a very nice discussion](http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2014/11/24/inequality-in-the-skies/) about "inequality in the skies" and how much room different classes of passenger get on the plane. Using some seating charts, she calculated some rough gini indexes of inequality on board. For example, for a transatlantic flight in a three-class configuration with fancy lie-flat beds up front, 

> if we look again at how the space is distributed, we now have 21% of the people using about 40% of the plane, 27% using another 20%, and the final 52% using the last 40%. The Gini index has now increased, to 25.

She also noted in passing that, as unequal as that is, "relative to the old-fashioned three-rows-of-first-class-and-the-rest-economy layout, is still nowhere near the inequality of the U.S., or the world." I found myself wondering what a plane laid out on the basis of the U.S. income distribution would look like. So, following Beth's lead I decided to get into the aviation business and launch **Air Gini**, America's most _American_ airline. First, for competitive context, here's an Airbus A330-300 with a three class configuration often seen on international flights. It has First Class, Business Class, and Economy Class cabins.

A regular airlines flying this layout will carry two hundred and twenty seven passengers. There are one hundred and seventy seven lucky duckies in Economy, forty two in Business, and eight in First Class. As Beth did, we can see that the seventy eight percent of passengers in Economy get about fifty eight percent of the seating space on the plane. Business Class passengers get just over thirty one percent of the room, and First Class passengers get about eleven percent of the space.

Those eight First Class passengers are about three and a half percent of the plane's population. Business class accounts for eighteen and a half percent or so. And the remaining seventy eight percent of this little society is in Economy. What if their space on the plane was allocated in proportion to the total income shares for those percentiles of U.S. society? With a bit of help from the [Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/), [Emmanuel Saez](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/), and the Federal Aviation Authority, Air Gini is proud to bring you the future of air travel.

In Air Gini's three-class layout, some things look familiar and some things are a bit different. For the majority of working stiffs traveling Economy, things are mostly unchanged. Their share of the seating space drops to just below fifty percent, making things even more cramped than before. (Remember that they make up seventy eight percent of the passengers.) In Managerial Class, meanwhile, things are also more compressed. Business Class is just over eighteen percent of the passengers but now they get only fifteen percent of the space. That's obviously still rather better than Economy class, but it's down from over thirty percent in the original plane. These guys are almost all in the top quintile of the income distribution, yet suddenly they feel a little angry. Odd as it is, some of the ones in the seats closest to the front even feel a bit poor.

What has happened? The answer is to be found in Ruling Class. Sorry, I mean, in First Class. On Air Ginie, these eight wealth creators---three and a half percent of all passengers---claim about thirty five percent of the available seating space. That's a lot of legroom. So much so, in fact, that as they spread out to take up the first third of the plane, Air Gini has had to replace the rather luxurious Business Class seats of the real-life configuration with still  comfortable but noticeably smaller chairs.

Our eight First Class passengers can really enjoy themselves. And yet, even here, the Air Gini layout hints that inequality extends all the way up even amongst top-flight travelers. Two of the first class seats are close to the front of Business Class, and behind a bulkhead. Awkward. The passenger in the very front row, meanwhile, has even more room to relax in than his peers. All things considered, you have to wonder exactly who is flying this plane---and more importantly, perhaps, who owns it.
