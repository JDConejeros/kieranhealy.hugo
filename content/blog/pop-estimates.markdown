Following a conversation on Twitter this morning, here's a quick plot of some GSS data from. Respondents were asked to estimate the percentage of people in the United States who fell into a range of (not necessarily exclusive) categories: White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Jewish. Here we show the median guess of White respondents and Black respondents, together with the actual percentage of people in each category (based on the 2000 Census). 

{{% figure src="http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/gss-group-pctby-race.png" alt="Estimates of racial and ethnic composition, by race." caption="Estimates of the percentage of Americans falling into various racial and ethnic categories, broken down by race of respondent (White or Black). Data: General Social Survey (2000) for guesses, and US Census (2000) for actual values." %}}

As you can see, people aren't very good at estimating these numbers. Both White and Black respondents underestimated the percentage of Whites in the US population by about the same amount, and substantially over-estimate the presence of various minority groups. Overestimates of the Hispanic population are about the same, while Black respondents overestimated the size of the Black, Asian, and Jewish US population to a greater degree than White respondents. Across the whole population (including an "Other" race category for respondents, not shown in the figure) the median guesses were 60 percent Whites, 30 percent Blacks, 20 percent Hispanics, 10 percent Asian, and 10 percent Jewish. If ten percent of the US population in 2000 were Jewish, that would have been more than double the total worldwide Jewish population.

The GSS hasn't asked this question since 2000, which is too bad. I'd be interested to see more recent estimates.
