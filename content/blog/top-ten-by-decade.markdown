My colleague [Jim Moody](http://www.soc.duke.edu/~jmoody77/) sent along some interesting data this morning. Using the Web of Science database, he took the most-cited papers in Sociology and produced a Top 10 list for each decade going back to the 1950s. Not a table of which papers were most popular *in* those decades, but a table of which papers are most-cited *from* those decades. So we're looking at the Top 10 most-cited papers that were *published* in the 1950s, 1960s, and so on. (This means that while the eleventh most-cited paper from the 1980s might outscore the fourth most-cited paper from the 1950s in terms of citations, the former does not appear here while the latter does. Note that the 1950s category is really "1950s and before". The universe of citing papers, meanwhile, is all of WoS.

I absolve Jim of any responsibility for the figure or my comments below. Here's a dotplot of the results:

{{% figure src="http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/cite-dotplot-by-decade-grouped.png" alt="Top 10 from Each Decade" caption="Sociology's Top 10 Most-Cited Papers from Each Decade, based on all-time citations in WoS." %}}

(You can get a [PDF version of this figure](http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/cite-dotplot-by-decade-grouped.pdf) if you want a closer look.) 

One thing to notice is the rise of articles from the _Annual Review of Sociology_ in the 2000s. Another is the increasing heterogeneity of outlets. Of the top ten papers written in the 1950s or before, eight appear in the *American Sociological Review*, one in the *American Journal of Sociology*, and one in *Social Forces*. (That is SF's only entry in the list, as it happens.) The 1960s are similarly ruled by ASR and AJS. After that, though, the there's more variety.  You can also see the long shadow of post-war university expansion and "Boomer Sociology". The most-cited work from before 1970 is not nearly as widely cited as the most-cited work from the '70s and '80s, despite having been around longer. The drop-off in the '90s and '00s is to be expected as those papers are younger.

There are some substantive trends, too. I think you can see the
importance of articles whose main contribution is either a
methodological contribution or a theoretical idea. Correspondingly,
there are rather fewer papers where a specific empirical finding is
the main contribution. If you want to be remembered, give people an
idea to work with or a tool to use. Of course, it's also true that
people tend to have a lot of unread books in the house and unused
tools in the garage.
