The [General Social Survey](http://gss.norc.org), or GSS, is one of the cornerstones of American social science and one of the most-analyzed datasets in Sociology. It is routinely used in research, in teaching, and as a reference point in discussions about changes in American society since the early 1970s. It is also a model of open, public data. The [National Opinion Research Center](http://norc.org) already provides many excellent tools for working with the data, and has long made it freely available to researchers. Casual users of the GSS can examine the [GSS Data Explorer](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org), and social scientists can [download complete datasets](http://gss.norc.org/Get-The-Data) directly and without restriction. At present, the GSS is provided to researchers in a choice of two commercial formats, Stata (`.dta`) and SPSS (`.sav`). It's not too difficult to get the data into R (especially now that the [Haven](http://haven.tidyverse.org) package is pretty reliable), but it can be a little annoying to have to do it repeatedly. After doing it one too many times, I got tired of it and I made a package instead. The `gssr` package provides the GSS Cumulative Data File (1972-2018) and the GSS Three Wave Panel Data File (2006-2010), together with their codebooks, in a format that makes it straightforward to get started working with them in R. The `gssr` package makes the GSS a little more accessible to users of R, the free software environment for statistical computing, and thus helps in a small way to make the GSS even more open than it already is. The package presently lives at <http://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/>, as it is still in development. There is a [vignette](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/articles/overview.html) providing an overview of what's included, and you can see the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/kjhealy/gssr).
