<h6>UNDERGRADUATE COURSES</h6>

<h2 class="shorttop"><a href="http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/teaching/organizations.pdf">Organizations and Management</a> </h2>
  <p>This course is taught as part of the <a href="http://www.markets.duke.edu/" title="Markets & Management Studies">Markets and Management Program</a>. It surveys the development of modern organizations and organizational analysis. The focus is on for-profit firms, but we will also look at other complex organizations as we go. We will explore different explanations of how organizations work, why they fail, how they should be managed, and how they connect with other aspects of society. The course will give you a critical grounding in basic organizational theory, and teach you how to put these ideas to work in the analysis of both real organizations and the huge body of scholarly and popular literature about them.</p>

   <h2><a href="http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/teaching/taboo-markets.pdf">Taboo Markets</a> </h2>
   
     <p>This course is about taboo, stigmatized, or otherwise morally controversial markets. Examples include trade in alcohol and other drugs, sex work, gambling, baby-selling, paid domestic labor, care work, human blood, organs, eggs, sperm, genetic material, viaticals, and pollution rights. We will read empirical studies and ethical arguments about these markets, focusing mostly on how exchange in these goods is practically accomplished and morally justified in theory and practice. We will also consider broader questions about the scope and limits, if any, of the market as a social institution, and its relationship to other sorts of exchange.<br /></p>
